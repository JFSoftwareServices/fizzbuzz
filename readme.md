# Mini Code Test: FizzBuzz

# What is FizzBuzz
FizzBuzz is an application that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of 
the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and 
the application five prints “FizzBuzz”.
